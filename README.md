# ToDo

This is a Ruby program that will parse through specified files and pull out
instances of @TODO. This allows a developer to leave notes for themselves
throughout their project.


## Getting Started

Run the parser using

```
./todo.rb
```

options

-f : List of files to parse
-p : Path to a config file that includes paths to files to parse, one per line


### Prerequisites

The only important prerequisite is Ruby.



### Installing

Installing is as simple as cloning or downloading this repository. Moving todo.rb
to a directory on your path or adding the directory it is in to your path will
allow you to run it from anywhere.
